# Smallify Links

An application made to shorten links.
Uses MongoDB for storing each shortened link.


## RECENT UPDATES
1. Added endpoint for adding new short url
2. Redirects are possible using the respected endpoint
3. Fixed a bug that could of caused overwrites/duplicated keys. 
4. Implemented VueJS to make the user interface slightly more appealing and reactive.
5. Added a 404 page for not found short-urls.
6. Added Rate limiting, 1 request per 30 seconds.
7. Made the client side slightly more appealing (in my opinion).
8. Changed the VueJS code to be slightly more efficient and display errors correctly.

### To Fix
1. CSS is poorly made so everything resizes to the biggest text.
2. The error handler.
